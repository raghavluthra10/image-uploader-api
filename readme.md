# About

This image uploading application is built using a combination of
technologies including Express.js for the server-side framework,
Postgres for the database, Knex.js for database connection and making
queries, TypeScript for type checking, React.js for the user interface,
Firebase Storage for storing the uploaded photos, and Docker for the
local development environment.

The application allows users to easily upload and manage their images,
with a streamlined and user-friendly interface. The use of Docker allows
for a consistent and easily replicable development environment, while
Firebase Storage provides a secure and reliable way to store and access
the uploaded images.
